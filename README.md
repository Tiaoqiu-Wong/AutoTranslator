# AutoTranslator
This is an improved version of my previous project ClickTranslator. This version uses a simple timer in order to translate the Japanese sentences in the invariant area into Simplified Chinese by using Baidu AI platform and Baidu Translation platform. I also optimized the programme to make it run faster.

This project is based on Python. Baidu AI platform and Baidu Translation platform are used. You need to own a Baidu account and register both 2 of the platforms mentioned above and have their authorized userid and key respectively before using the program. After getting the userid and key, please fill them in the blanks of the Python file. I would not offer userid and key.

I will build a menu which contains a series of options in a bid to make it easiler for users to set items like target language, original language, screenshot area,etc.As long as I have free time.

There still exsits some small bugs in the project. I will fix them in the next version. If you see this project and have interest in improving this program(including giving a better GUI, optimizing the codes, etc.), please do it and email me. My email address is 2672550737@qq.com. Thank you.
